# Code With Me

This repository contains NVIDIA Omniverse extensions and projects created during [my live coding sessions
on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mati-codes). The goal of these projects and live coding sessions is to teach Omniverse development by example and to show developer workflows for creating Omniverse extensions, connectors and applications.

I have created a tag for every past live coding session to record the state of the project at the end of the session. If you want to go back in time and see the exact code from a livestream, use the tags.

Feel free to use any examples from these projects and reach out to me if you have any questions.
